# TomaBot Avatar Setup

## To set up the TomaBot avatar:

1. **Save the portrait image** as `tomabot-avatar.png`
2. **Place it in the `public/` folder** (same folder as favicon.png)
3. **The image should be:**
   - PNG format
   - Square dimensions (e.g., 200x200px or 400x400px)
   - Clear and professional looking

## Current Configuration:
- **Position:** Bottom-right corner
- **Avatar:** `/tomabot-avatar.png`
- **Size:** 40px
- **Z-index:** 9999 (always on top)

## If the avatar doesn't show:
1. **Check the file name** - must be exactly `tomabot-avatar.png`
2. **Check the file location** - must be in the `public/` folder
3. **Clear browser cache** - Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh
4. **Check browser console** for any image loading errors

The TomaBot should appear in the bottom-right corner with the portrait as its avatar once the image is properly placed.
