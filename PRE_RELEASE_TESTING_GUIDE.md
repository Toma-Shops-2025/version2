### 2. Pre-Build Testing Steps

#### A. Local Development Testing
```bash
# 1. Clean and rebuild
npm run build:prod
npx cap clean android
npx cap sync android

# 2. Test on local device/emulator
npx cap run android
```

#### B. Debug APK Testing
```bash
# Build debug APK for testing
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

**Test the debug APK on:**
- [ ] Your own device
- [ ] Different Android versions (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)
- [ ] Different screen sizes
- [ ] Both WiFi and mobile data

### 3. Common Crash Causes & Fixes

### 4. Release Build Testing

#### A. Build Release APK
```bash
# Clean everything first
cd android
./gradlew clean

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

#### B. Test Release APK Locally
1. Install the release APK on your device
2. Test all major features:

### 6. Build AAB for Google Play

#### A. Build AAB
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

#### B. Test AAB Locally
```bash
# Install bundletool
# Download from: https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases

# Generate APKs from AAB
java -jar bundletool-all-1.15.6.jar build-apks --bundle=app-release.aab --output=app-release.apks

# Install on device
java -jar bundletool-all-1.15.6.jar install-apks --apks=app-release.apks
```

### 7. Google Play Console Testing

#### A. Upload to Internal Testing
1. Upload AAB to Google Play Console
2. Add testers to internal testing track
3. Wait for processing (usually 10-30 minutes)

#### B. Tester Instructions
Send testers this message:
```
ðŸŽ¯ TomaShops Testing Instructions:

1. Download the app from the Google Play link
2. Install and open the app
3. Test these features:
   - App opens without crashing

   - Can record videos
   - Can upload content
   - Can send messages
   - Can receive notifications

- Take a screenshot if possible

Thank you for testing! ðŸš€
```

### 8. Emergency Fixes

If testers report crashes:

#### A. Quick Debug Steps
1. Check Google Play Console for crash reports
2. Test on the same device model
3. Check if it's a specific Android version issue

#### B. Common Quick Fixes
1. **ProGuard issues**: Disable minification temporarily
2. **Memory issues**: Reduce app size
3. **Network issues**: Check API endpoints
4. **Permission issues**: Check runtime permissions

### 9. Build Commands Summary

```bash
# Full build process
npm run build:prod
npx cap clean android
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Test locally first
./gradlew assembleRelease
# Install and test the APK on your device

# Then upload AAB to Google Play Console
```

### 10. Success Criteria

The app is ready for testers when:
- [ ] Debug APK works on your device
- [ ] Release APK works on your device
- [ ] AAB installs and works on your device
- [ ] All major features work in release build
- [ ] No crashes during normal usage
- [ ] App opens within 5 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Checklist Before Sending to Testers

- [ ] Version code updated
- [ ] All features tested in release build
- [ ] App opens without crashes
- [ ] AAB uploaded to Google Play Console
- [ ] Internal testing track configured
- [ ] Testers added to internal testing
- [ ] Tester instructions sent
- [ ] Backup plan ready if issues arise

## ðŸš¨ If App Still Crashes

1. **Immediate**: Disable ProGuard minification
2. **Debug**: Add crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)
3. **Test**: Build without optimization
4. **Fix**: Address specific crash causes
5. **Re-test**: Full testing cycle again

Remember: It's better to delay testing than to give testers a broken app!
